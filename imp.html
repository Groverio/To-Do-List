          A to-do list keeps tasks organized, allowing you to view everything at
          a glance and prioritize effectively. It reduces clutter and ensures
          you don’t forget deadlines.
          <strong>Example:</strong> When planning a group project, listing tasks
          like researching and drafting helps assign roles and track progress.

        <p class="toggle-paragraph">
          A clear task list helps you focus on your goals, minimizing
          distractions and boosting efficiency. By breaking tasks into smaller
          steps, you avoid feeling overwhelmed and improve your productivity.
          <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of tackling a large project at once,
          break it down into tasks like "research," "outline," and "proofread."
          This makes the project feel more manageable, and checking off each
          completed task gives you a sense of achievement, motivating you to
          continue.

        <p class="toggle-paragraph">
          A to-do list reduces the mental burden of remembering tasks, lowering
          anxiety levels. Writing everything down prevents the worry of
          forgetting important responsibilities.
          <strong>Example:</strong> If your week is packed, listing your tasks
          helps you prioritize and stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.
